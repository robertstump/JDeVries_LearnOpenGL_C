Working through Joey DeVries <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL </a> book, translating the lessons roughly into C.

Did not include GLFW or GLAD in the repo as the book wants to walk through setting up the dependencies etc. Swapped out glm math library for linmath for early chapters. Will probably add cglm if linmath is insufficient.
